# deontobot
Deontic logic, with its formalisation of concepts of obligation and prohibition, has many applications within and without Computer Science. This project proposes a formal specification and proof strategy for deontic theorems, with ethics applications as case studies. The final tool comprises a grammar for semi-structured input and a brute force prover utility. It offers a user-friendly syntax and exhaustive proof strategy, including modus ponens, modus tollens and O-necessitation. It succeeds against implemented case studies, and provides thoughtful results for evaluation of ethics applications and deontic concepts, with scope for expansion over more complex case studies and various other areas of implementation.
