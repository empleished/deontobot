Prover workflow
Read in list of statements about the world (data set of facts).
Read in goal.
while data set doesn't contain goal.
choose member of data set via some strategy
choose a rule to apply to generate new fact
if new fact created add to data set

Note, need to know when to stop (i.e. cannot generate any new facts).

Example program:
Facts:
A
A -> B
Goal:
B
Prover would apply rule A ^ (A->B) => B
Would add B to fact set
Check fact set contains B (it does).
halt.
report sequence of steps to prove B (what rules were applied).

useful pieces of code: 
for node in tree.body - for every node in the tree
self.generic_visit(node) - visit children of the node
node.body[-1] - gets the last node in a function's body
