\begin{abstract}
A formalisation of deontic logic to represent the obligations, prohibitions and permissions within a system, which can then be checked for coherency and consistency to determine the validity of the set of rules.

\pagenumbering{arabic}

\section{Background and Motivation}
Deontic logic is a logic of duty, which formalises conceptions of what should and should not be done. These conceptions can include obligations, prohibitions, permissions, omissions, oughts and optionals. 
%Briefly explain what deontic logic is, why I'd want to do what I'm doing. 

\section{Objectives and Achievements}
%What did I set out to achieve and what have I achieved. 

\section{Structure}
%What's coming next in the dissertation. 

\chapter{Literature Review}

\section{History of Deontic Logic}
%Explain what deontic logic is, what it means to be obliged, prohibited, permitted, etc. Outline various types of deontic logic. Talk about the history/development of deontic logic. 

\section{Applications of Deontic Logic}
%Places it is already being used/could be used. Look for CS examples as well as others. 

\section{Functionality}
%Things which already exist which kind of do what I'm doing - explain why they aren't sufficient and what I'm doing differently.
